EQcorrscan is a young project, and we have yet to integrate a great many things,
however this page serves to outline what we plan to integrate, with a rough
release timeline.  All of these dates are very rough and depend on how much
everyone contributes.  Any comments are welcome
on the issue [tracker](https://github.com/calum-chamberlain/EQcorrscan/issues/3).

## Release 0.1.1 - Jun/July 2016
* Development of a subspace detector;
* Incorporate automatic re-picker for detected events;
* Integrate with hypoDDpy and StreamPick for standard observatory
practices including picking of templates, and locations.

## Release 0.1.2 - December 2016
* Finish development of [tests for all functions](https://github.com/calum-chamberlain/EQcorrscan/issues/11);
* Port to Windows systems;
* Development of a GUI front-end for template generation and parameter set-up
to ensure users set up programs correctly.
